Orchestra Display is an interactive polling and outreach tool designed for the [Alexandria Symphony Orchestra](http://www.alexsym.org/ "Alexandria Symphony Orchestra") at a [Code for Northern Virginia](http://codefornova.org/ "Code for America - Northern Virginia Brigade") hackathon at the Durant Center in Alexandria, Va., on the National Day of Civic Hacking on June 6, 2015.

Orchestra Display allows patrons to submit responses via their mobile devices to a question or poll posted by event organizers and displays the aggreated responses in a visually appealing or useful way on screens operated by the event host.
